// bad-news-lexicon.mjs — R8 trigger: a negative-lexicon gate over a substantive message.
//
// WHAT THIS DECIDES (the deterministic half only)
//   Does the message have ≥ 200 substantive chars AND contain a word from the negative
//   lexicon (failed, failure, error, broke, broken, blocker, regression, cannot, can't,
//   rejected, lost, missed, wrong — configurable)? That is the TRIGGER. Lexicon words match
//   at word START, case-insensitively, so "errors" matches "error" and "terror" does not.
//
// WHY THE GATE IS DELIBERATELY OVER-INCLUSIVE
//   "Fixed the error" and "tests failed yesterday, now green" both trip this gate while
//   carrying no bad news at all. That is fine, because the gate decides APPLICABILITY, not
//   guilt: whether a message contains GENUINELY bad news — and whether the first substantive
//   sentence states it — is the whole judgment, and it belongs to the judge. A deterministic
//   version of that judgment would flag every message that mentions an error on its way to
//   reporting success.
//
// Usage:
//   import { badNewsGate, badNewsQuestion } from "./bad-news-lexicon.mjs";
