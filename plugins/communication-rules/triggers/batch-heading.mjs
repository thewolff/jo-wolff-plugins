// batch-heading.mjs — R3 trigger: a trailing section whose heading is a batch label.
//
// WHAT THIS DECIDES (the deterministic half only)
//   Does the message END with a labeled section — a heading like "Uncertainties", "Open
//   questions", "Questions", "Caveats", "Notes" — that contains substance? That is the
//   TRIGGER. Whether that section is a violation is a judgment and belongs to the judge:
//   sweeping detached questions into a terminal dump is the violation; a legitimate terminal
//   summary is not; and the needs-you-first rule REQUIRES a lead section pulling decisions to
//   the top, which is compliant with this rule by design. A deterministic version of the
//   judgment would fight that rule directly.
//
// WHAT COUNTS AS THE TRIGGER
//   - A heading is a #{1,6} line, or a bold pseudo-heading line ("**Notes**") whose normalized
//     text equals a configured batch heading.
//   - The matched heading must be the LAST heading in the text — a "## Questions" buried
//     mid-message under later sections is not the trailing dump this rule is about.
//   - The section after it must contain at least one prose line; an empty labeled section is
//     ceremony, not a dump, and the trigger stays quiet.
//
// Usage:
//   import { findTrailingBatchSection, batchByLabelQuestion, batchJudgeContext } from "./batch-heading.mjs";
