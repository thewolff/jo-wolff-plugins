// conclusion-first.mjs — R4 trigger: long enough, and structured in paragraphs.
//
// WHAT THIS DECIDES (the deterministic half only)
//   Is the message ≥ 400 substantive chars AND ≥ 2 substantive paragraphs? That is the
//   trigger. Whether the FIRST substantive sentence states the message's decision or verdict
//   — versus being setup — is a judgment and belongs to the judge. A keyword version of that
//   judgment fires on every message that opens with context for a good reason, which is most
//   of them.
//
// WHY 400 AND 2
//   The needs-you floor (200) protects short exchanges from structural checks; this rule
//   needs more, because "conclusion first" is trivially satisfied by any one-paragraph
//   answer — there is nowhere else for the point to be. Two paragraphs is the minimum shape
//   in which a conclusion CAN be buried.
//
// WHAT A PARAGRAPH IS
//   A run of prose lines broken by a blank line, a heading, or a fence. List items are prose
//   (the bullet is stripped); an HTML-comment envelope does not break a paragraph.
//
// Usage:
//   import { conclusionFirstApplicable, conclusionFirstQuestion } from "./conclusion-first.mjs";
