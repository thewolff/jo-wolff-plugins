// state.mjs — where the enforcement half keeps its inspectable traces.
//
// WHY A STATE DIRECTORY AT ALL
//   Fail-open machinery that leaves no trace is indistinguishable from machinery that was
//   never wired. Every skip, every warning, every swallowed error goes to a file under
//   ~/.claude/.communication-rules-state/ so an operator can answer "did it run?" by looking
//   rather than by believing. The loop guard's per-session hash and the judge cache live
//   there too.
//
// WHY LOGGING SWALLOWS ITS OWN FAILURES
//   A read-only home must not turn a fail-open hook into a crashing one. A log line that
//   cannot be written is lost; that is the honest cost of fail-open, and it is paid here
//   deliberately rather than by throwing at the caller.

// file disables enforcement within one turn. Same precedent as the identifier URL resolver.
