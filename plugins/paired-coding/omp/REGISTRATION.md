# REGISTRATION.md: how this adapter goes live on OMP

`paired-coding-omp.ts` is the OMP half of the gate and is tested by the suite beside it. Nothing
loads it until you choose to, and each way of loading it below has a written reversal: the
install command, a flag you pass, or a symlink you make. OMP never picks it up from a checkout
on its own.

Below, `<checkout>` is the absolute path of your clone of this repository.

## What it needs

- macOS with `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec`. `pair_run`, and the write inside `pair_write` and
  `pair_edit`, run under a Seatbelt profile that fences file writes, hard links and Unix-domain
  socket connections (the DNS resolver's excepted), and leaves TCP open. On any other platform
  `pair_start` refuses, and the session stays inert.
- OMP's extension API: `pi.on("tool_call" | "input" | "session_shutdown" |
  "session_before_switch" | "session_switch" | "session_before_branch" | "session_branch" |
  "session_tree")`, `pi.registerTool`, `pi.getAllTools`, `pi.sendMessage`, `pi.zod`, and
  `ctx.ui.notify` when a UI is present.
  Verified against `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent` 18.4.4.
- Nothing else. The adapter imports `core/gate.mjs` and `lib/*.mjs`, which use Node built-ins
  only, so OMP's loader imports them as they are.

## Registration routes

Three routes. Pick one.

1. **Install the plugin** (the usual route). From a shell:

   ```
   omp plugin marketplace add thewolff/jo-wolff-plugins
   omp plugin install paired-coding@jo-wolff-plugins
   ```

   Inside a running session use `/marketplace add` and `/marketplace install` with the same
   arguments; `/plugin install` inside OMP installs nothing. The plugin's `package.json` declares
   this file under `omp.extensions`, which OMP loads for installed marketplace plugins, and its
   `.omp-plugin/plugin.json` sets `mcpServers` to `{}`, so the Claude Code MCP server `pair`
   stays hidden on OMP. Every omp process you then run, in any repository, loads the adapter,
   which stays inert until `pair_start`. Tested on OMP 18.4.4 with a scratch home: install
   exited 0; with no `-e`, the eight `pair_*` tools registered, no MCP route appeared, and there
   were no extension errors; `pair_start` then refused a host `write`, and a session without
   `pair_start` wrote normally and created no state. `omp plugin upgrade` and
   `omp plugin install --force` keep the adapter registered. `omp --no-extensions` starts one
   process without it. Do not also pass `-e` for this file in an installed setup: whether two
   copies of the gate then both run was not checked.

   The versions in `package.json` and `.omp-plugin/plugin.json` move with
   `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` on every release, because OMP upgrades by version number.

Routes 2 and 3 load the file from a checkout without installing the plugin. Use one of them
instead of route 1, not as well.

2. **One omp process only** (a first try without installing). Pass the file with `-e`
   (`--extension`) to a single omp started by hand, together with `--plugin-dir` for the skill:

   ```
   omp --plugin-dir <checkout>/plugins/paired-coding \
       -e <checkout>/plugins/paired-coding/omp/paired-coding-omp.ts
   ```

   Each flag loads half: `--plugin-dir` loads the skill but not the `pair_*` tools, and `-e`
   loads the tools but not the skill. Tested on OMP 18.4.4 with both: the eight `pair_*` tools
   appeared once each, the skill was listed, and the journal recorded one input entry per typed
   turn, so one copy of the gate ran.

   Only that process loads the adapter, and nothing on disk changes to register it. `-e` and
   `--extension` push onto the same list (`setExtension` in `src/cli/flag-tables.ts` of
   `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent`). `main.ts` hands that list to the session as
   `additionalExtensionPaths`. Add `--no-extensions` to load this file and nothing from
   `~/.omp/agent/extensions/`. That flag switches discovery to `explicit-only`, and files
   named with `-e` still load (`mode: parsedArgs.noExtensions ? "explicit-only" : "merge"` in
   `src/main.ts`).

3. **Shared auto-discovery.** Symlink the file into the directory every omp process scans:

   ```
   ln -s <checkout>/plugins/paired-coding/omp/paired-coding-omp.ts \
         ~/.omp/agent/extensions/paired-coding-omp.ts
   ```

   Then every omp process on the machine loads it. The adapter does nothing in a session
   until `pair_start` is called there (see *Inert until pair_start*). A loaded but inactive
   adapter still adds the eight `pair_*` tools to every session's tool list: `pair_start`,
   `pair_note`, `pair_propose`, `pair_begin`, `pair_write`, `pair_edit`, `pair_run` and
   `pair_done`. None of them ends pairing.

### Environment

- `PAIRED_CODING_STATE_DIR`: where each session's state, journal and snapshots live, as
  `<dir>/<omp-session-id>/`. It defaults to `~/.local/state/paired-coding/`, which is also
  used when the value is not an absolute path. Keep it outside every checkout. `pair_run`'s sandbox
  denies writes to it, and `pair_write` / `pair_edit` refuse paths inside it.
- `PAIRED_CODING_CONFLICTING_TOOLS`: optional, tool names separated by commas. See *One write
  gate per session*.

### Inert until pair_start

Every handler first checks for the session's activation marker. That check is an `existsSync`,
and it creates no file. Without the marker, host tools pass untouched and no state directory
is created. `pair_start` writes the marker.

### One write gate per session

If another gate in your sessions also owns write enforcement, list one of its tools in
`PAIRED_CODING_CONFLICTING_TOOLS` so the two gates never run together. `pair_start` reads
`pi.getAllTools()`, and if a listed tool is registered in the session, it refuses and names
that tool. The adapter then stays inert. Entries are trimmed, and empty entries are ignored.
When the variable is unset or empty, the check is skipped.

A tool name is used because OMP's extension API offers no list of the other loaded
extensions. `getExtensionPaths` and `isExtensionActive` exist on the runner but not on
`ExtensionAPI` (`src/extensibility/extensions/types.ts`).

## Exact reversal

1. Remove the registration. For the install route:
   `omp plugin uninstall paired-coding@jo-wolff-plugins`. For the one-process site, exit that
   omp process; there is nothing on disk to undo. For the shared site:
   `rm ~/.omp/agent/extensions/paired-coding-omp.ts`.
2. Optional: delete the session state, `rm -r "${PAIRED_CODING_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.local/state/paired-coding}"`.
   The journal is the record of what pairing allowed and refused, so read it first if anything
   went wrong.
3. `git revert <this commit's sha>` in your clone.

## Ending pairing inside a live session

- Typing `pair stop` in the editor, as the whole message (case and surrounding spaces do not
  matter), ends pairing for the session in any phase. The adapter kills and reaps every
  `pair_run` process group, takes the final snapshot, journals any write it did not approve,
  journals `stop` with verb `typed-stop`, and returns the session to inactive. The editor shows
  "paired coding is off: you typed pair stop", and the agent gets hidden context on that turn:
  "paired-coding: your partner typed pair stop, so pairing has ended in this session. The gate
  no longer refuses host tools. Pairing starts again only if your partner asks for it and you
  call pair_start." Your typed text is not changed. The same words arriving from an extension
  or over RPC end nothing.
- No tool ends pairing. The agent cannot stop the gate it works under.
- Exiting omp ends pairing. On `session_shutdown` the adapter kills and reaps every `pair_run`
  process group, takes the final snapshot and returns the session to inactive.
- `/new`, `/fork` and `/resume` keep this extension loaded but give the agent a new session id
  (`session_before_switch` and `session_switch`, reasons `new`, `fork` and `resume`, in
  `src/session/agent-session.ts`). The branch `/btw` makes, and a branch requested over RPC or
  by an extension, do the same through `session_before_branch` and `session_branch`. If the
  session being left was pairing, the adapter ends it as on shutdown and starts the new session
  with pairing still on and the card closed: no card, no open change set, host writes,
  `pair_note` and `pair_propose` refused, journal entry `carried-after-clear` with reason
  `omp:new`, `omp:fork`, `omp:resume` or `omp:branch`. The editor shows "paired coding:
  pairing is still on and the card is closed in this session. Tell the agent to keep pairing,
  or type pair stop to end it". The agent waits for your answer and calls `pair_start` only
  once you say to keep pairing.
- `/tree`, and the interactive `/branch` back to an earlier message, keep the session id and
  move to another point in the same session file; in 18.4.4 they fire `session_tree`, not
  `session_branch`. The agent's context is then another branch, which does not hold the
  agreement, so the adapter handles the move like `/clear`: pairing ends, the card and change
  set are dropped, and the same session carries on with pairing still on and the card closed,
  journaling `carried-after-clear` with reason `omp:tree`. The editor shows "paired coding:
  pairing is still on and the card is closed, because you moved to another point in the
  conversation. Tell the agent to keep pairing, or type pair stop to end it". The agent gets
  hidden context on its next turn (`TREE_NOTICE` in the adapter): the conversation moved but
  the files were not rewound, so edits made for later cards may already be on disk; pairing is
  still on and the card is closed; it tells you so in one line, asks plainly whether to keep
  pairing or whether you will type `pair stop`, and waits.
- OMP's own `/clear` drops the conversation but keeps the session id
  (`src/slash-commands/builtin-lifecycle.ts`, "Clear the conversation context in place, keeping
  the session"), and it fires no extension event. It does append a `reset_boundary` entry to the
  session (`appendResetBoundary` in `src/session/session-manager.ts`), which the extension can
  read through `ctx.sessionManager.getEntries()`. Before every `input` and `tool_call` the adapter
  looks for a new one. If pairing was active, it ends pairing as on shutdown, finishing any open
  change set, and keeps the same session with pairing still on and the card closed, journaling
  `carried-after-clear` with reason `omp:clear`. The editor shows "paired coding: pairing is
  still on and the card is closed, because the conversation was cleared. Tell the agent to keep
  pairing, or type pair stop to end it". Because the session id is kept, the next `pair_start`
  also offers the roadmap this session recorded before the clear, if cards are still open or
  not ready.
- There is no separate kill switch. To run omp without the gate, start a process that does
  not load this file.

## What a typed turn means here

The trusted-input signal is OMP's `input` event. The interactive editor emits that event with
`source: "interactive"` (`src/modes/controllers/input-controller.ts`, the `emitInput(...,
"interactive")` call). Text that an extension injects with `pi.sendUserMessage` does not pass
through it. Text arriving over RPC carries `source: "rpc"`. Only `interactive` turns can carry
the agreement that `pair_begin` quotes, or a `pair stop`.

## Live proof

These runs used one omp process per test session, started with `--no-extensions -e
<this file>` in throwaway git repositories, with `PAIRED_CODING_STATE_DIR` pointing outside
them. Every verdict was judged by content snapshots of the repository: every path, including
untracked and ignored files, with its type and a content hash.

- The adversarial tests 11 to 17 listed in the plugin README behaved as expected, on OMP
  18.4.4 with the cheapest available model.
- Test 16 loaded a second extension that rewrote every `pair_write` path and every `pair_run`
  command to a target outside the boundary. Both writes were still refused.
- Test 14 killed and reaped the process group on abort and on timeout, checked by pid.
- A session with the adapter loaded but no `pair_start` let `write`, `bash` and `eval` create
  files, and created no state directory.

Those runs predate the typed stop, whole-word quotes and session carry-over. These were then
run with the same launch flags, judged from the journal and the tool results:

- A typed `pair stop` in a turn with no tool call ended pairing, and the next `write` was
  allowed. A `pair stop` injected with `pi.sendUserMessage` changed nothing, and the next
  `write` was refused.
- A `pair_begin` quote of `y` against a typed `why? …` was refused as not whole words.
- `/new` while pairing started the new session closed: `write` refused until `pair_start`.
- `/clear` with a change set open and a stray file in the worktree journaled the stray file as
  an unapproved write, closed the change set, and kept the session closed: `pair_write` refused
  with "no change set is open", `write` refused, `pair_start` restarted pairing, and a typed
  `pair stop` ended it.

Two things the runs did leave behind. First, omp's own prompt history
(`~/.omp/agent/history.db`) records prompts typed in the TUI, whatever extensions are loaded.
Second, omp's session files go wherever `--session-dir` points, or to omp's default sessions
directory.
