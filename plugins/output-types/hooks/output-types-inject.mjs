// output-types-inject.mjs — SessionStart injection of the output-types operative core.
//
// WHY THIS HOOK EXISTS
//   The contract governs every assertion, and a skill fires in response to one — which is one
//   beat too late. A skill's text does stay in context for the rest of a session once it loads,
//   so the gap is not leakage; it is the window before the load, and the first assertion of a
//   session is usually in the first turn. This hook closes that window. The skill carries the
//   fuller contract for when it fires; this carries the part that must be in force before the
//   first tool call.
//
// WHY IT READS THE SKILL INSTEAD OF CARRYING TEXT
//   Two copies of one contract drift, and nothing detects it. So the injected text lives inside
//   skills/output-types/SKILL.md between `<!-- inject:start -->` and `<!-- inject:end -->`, and
//   this file emits exactly that span. Editing the skill IS editing what sessions receive. The
//   only text this hook owns is the single pointer line appended at the end, which cannot live
//   in the span because it reads differently inside the skill than it does injected.
//
// NO SCOPE GATE, DELIBERATELY
//   A plugin somebody chose to install is the opt-in. A gate here would reproduce the defect
//   this plugin was extracted away from: machinery that is present, believed live, and silent.
//   The off-switch is OUTPUT_TYPES_INJECT=off, so a person can silence it without uninstalling.
//
// FAIL-OPEN, BUT NOT FAIL-SILENT
//   Every error path exits 0 — a broken hook must never break somebody's session. But a hook
//   that fails silently is indistinguishable from a hook that is working, which is the exact
//   confusion this contract exists to prevent. So a failure emits one short line saying the core
//   did not load. It costs nothing when things work.
//
// Contract: read JSON on stdin (SessionStart payload; unused, but consumed so the pipe closes).
// Emit hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext, exit 0.
